# Capstone_BIA
My Final Capstone project for completing my Data science &amp; AI course from BIA. 
The “Vehicle Price Prediction and Visualization” project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the prices of premium cars. By combining data science methodologies with Power BI visualizations, this project addresses several key aspects. In the automotive industry, accurate price estimation is crucial for both buyers and sellers. Buyers need to make informed decisions, while sellers want to optimize their pricing strategies. Machine learning models provide a systematic approach to predict car prices based on relevant features, such as brand-model, mileage, engine specifications etc

#Objectives:
The primary objective of the project is to develop accurate machine learning models that predict the prices of premium cars. By analysing relevant features such as brand, model, mileage, and engine specifications, these models will provide reliable price estimates. Additionally, the project aims to enhance decision-making in the automotive industry by creating insightful Power BI visualizations based on the predicted prices.
